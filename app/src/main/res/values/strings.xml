         <!-- 5..Dream CAD  -->
             If you’re the sort to heap righteous critique to those ill-designed nonsensical design plans that fail to reach the
            meager expectations one would unwittingly dare have of them, then YOU sir/ma’am are the one we’ve been waiting for to make
            a designing wonder that’d drive reviewing critics into frenzy. Or are you?

            If you say you are a student of the Electronic age, then we’d say that you show us some justification.
            How? This two stage event will test your circuit making capabilities and be a proof of why electronics is a
            stream youthful and eternal. Just don’t blow up any ICs in the process, in your head or otherwise.

         <!-- 7. Energy Contraption  -->
            Usually the task of opening a water bottle and pouring it into a glass is an act that requires all the
			complex skill and physical dexterity of a 5 year old.\n\nNow, add a limit to the number of possible direct
			interactions, maximum energy efficiency and a limited six by six area and we have an interesting
			situation in our hands. Oh and do not forget about the time limit! Believe yourself to be creative?
			Be the best at this very simple task to know for real.

            Any rear scratching cave-dwelling cretin can make a craggy cave to keep the sun and the rain at bay.
            It requires the hands of a master to give birth to a structure so majestic, it stops being a building and
            starts being a monument. And that is the truest path to immortality for the apprentice in the trade of the brick
            and mortar. Are you Eiffel enough?

            I’d urge you to guess, again.\n\n
            This competition involves not flights of bumbling fantasy but rather a
            representation of your technical perception on the issues provided. And in a physical form no less.

		 world\'s\ greatest treasure is stored. We DARE you, to Google it!
